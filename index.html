            <p class="mb1">In this workshop I'm going to share with you the forgotten 100-year-old prayer that changed my life. My hope is that this prayer will help you unlock abundance without wasting hours trying to get in touch with the vibrations of the universe.<p>

<p class="mb1">Now I'm guessing for a lot of you this is probably not your first time trying to attract abundance in your life. The first thing I want to mention is that if the Law of Attraction hasn't worked for you in the past, it's not your fault. There's a lot of information out there, and it can be confusing. Many times that information overload keeps you from success. It's okay.</p>

<p class="mb1">If you've been concerned in the past that you just can't manifest abundance in your life, I want to put those fears to rest. You can do this. You just need the right person to explain it to you.</p>

<p class="mb1">The spiritual gurus want you to think that you need some magical powers to unlock abundance in your life. I'm here to tell you they're wrong. They have their own reasons for wanting you to think that, but it's not true.</p>

<p class="mb1">If you've ever thought that the government or banks actually want to keep you from attracting abundance, you're probably right. They don't benefit from you succeeding. They want to keep you in debt and in need of their help. The difference with me is that I actually care about your success and truly want to see you living the life of your dreams.</p>

<p class="mb1">So that's what I'm here for. I know you have a dream to finally start living the life you were meant to live, and I want to show you how to make that happen during this training.</p>

<p class="mb1">My goal for this workshop is to help two types of people. For those who are new to prayer, you'll learn the forgotten 100-year-old prayer that helped me attract abundance in my life. For the people that already use prayer in their daily lives, you'll discover how to start getting your prayers answered on a regular basis.</p>

<p class="mb1">Now if you told me 5 years ago that I would be sharing my secrets to attracting abundance through prayer, I would have said you were crazy.</p>

<p class="mb1">You see, I haven't always been a picture-perfect Christian.</p>

<p class="mb1">So, I'm not going to sit here and preach to you. I'm sure you get plenty of that each week at your own church.</p>

<p class="mb1">Instead, I just want to tell you a few stories about my journey to abundance and how I discovered what I call <a href="https://www.abundancescrolls.com">the 7 Secret Abundance Scrolls</a>.</p>

<p class="mb1">Is it okay if I share my story with you?</p>
