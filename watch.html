<p class="mb1">A few years ago I went on a journey to discover how to unlock abundance through prayer. I uncovered many secrets along the way and began to see my life transform in ways I never could have imagined.</p>

<p class="mb1">Today I would like to share these same secrets with you…</p>

<p class="mb1">In just a moment I'm going to share with you the forgotten 100-year-old prayer that changed my life. </p>

<p class="mb1">But before I do, I want to share another secret with you that I recently discovered. </p>

<p class="mb1">One of the easiest things I did to start getting my prayers answered was to write in my prayer journal each morning. </p>

<p class="mb1">This had such a big impact on my life, I knew I had to share it with others. </p>

<p class="mb1">So, I created a printable version of my prayer journal that you can print out at home and start using today.</p>

            <h2>How a Forgotten 100-Year-Old Prayer Changed My Life</h2>
            
<p class="mb1">Now that you have the key to getting your prayers answered, I'm excited to share with you the story of how a forgotten 100-year-old prayer changed my life. </p>

<p class="mb1">My hope is that this prayer will help you unlock abundance without wasting hours trying to get in touch with the vibrations of the universe.</p>

<p class="mb1">Now I'm guessing for a lot of you this is probably not your first time trying to attract abundance in your life. </p>

<p class="mb1">The first thing I want to mention is that if the Law of Attraction hasn't worked for you in the past, it's not your fault. </p>

<p class="mb1">There's a lot of information out there, and it can be confusing. Many times that information overload keeps you from success.</p>

<p class="mb1">If you've been concerned in the past that you just can't manifest abundance in your life, I want to put those fears to rest. You can do this. You just need the right person to explain it to you.</p>

<p class="mb1">The spiritual gurus want you to think that you need some magical powers to unlock abundance in your life. I'm here to tell you they're wrong. They have their own reasons for wanting you to think that, but it's not true.</p>

<p class="mb1">If you've ever thought that the government or banks are blocking you from attracting abundance, you're probably right. </p>

<p class="mb1">They don't benefit from you succeeding. They want to keep you in debt and in need of their help. </p>

<p class="mb1">The difference with me is that I actually care about your success and truly want to see you living the life of your dreams.</p>

<p class="mb1">So that's what I'm here for. I know you have a dream to finally start living the life you were meant to live, and I want to show you how to make that happen.</p>

<p class="mb1">Now if you told me 5 years ago that I would be sharing my secrets to attracting abundance through prayer, I would have said you were crazy.</p>

<p class="mb1">You see, I haven't always been a picture perfect Christian. So, I'm not going to sit here and preach to you. I'm sure you get plenty of that each week at your own church.</p>

<p class="mb1">Instead, I just want to tell you a few stories about my journey to abundance and how I discovered the forgotten 100-year-old prayer that changed my life.</p>

<p class="mb1">Is it okay if I share my story with you?</p>

<p class="mb1">A few years ago I was in a rut and feeling like I was not living up to my full potential. I didn't want to get out of bed in the morning and when I got home from work I just wanted to sink into the couch. </p>

<p class="mb1">This wasn't the type of person I knew I was on the inside and I wanted to change.</p>

<p class="mb1">The most frustrating part about this whole situation was that I was getting ready to propose to my girlfriend but I was missing the most important part: the ring.</p>

<p class="mb1">I needed to figure out how to get out of this rut and start saving money. Otherwise, there was no way I was going to be able to afford an engagement ring anytime soon.</p>

<p class="mb1">Then one fateful morning it hit me: I should start an affirmation journal!</p>

<p class="mb1">I had this belief that writing daily affirmations would help me stop feeling so blue and get back on the right track.</p>

<p class="mb1">Inside my journal, I planned to write about the things I hoped to achieve, and hopefully, manifest the things I desired.</p>

<p class="mb1">After reading books like The Secret or Think & Grow Rich, I was taught that I should think about what I want, not about what I want to avoid.</p>

<p class="mb1">I thought wishful thinking would be the magic bullet that would solve all my problems.</p>

<p class="mb1">However, accomplishing this goal of manifesting success each morning wasn’t going to be easy for me because I am a very slow writer.</p>

<p class="mb1">Plus, I wasn’t sure if I could find the time to write in my journal each morning.</p>

<p class="mb1">Not to mention, I was a little nervous about what others might think of me if they read my journal and learned about the types of struggles I was having.</p>

<p class="mb1">Immediately, I ran into a problem that most people have when trying to use the law of attraction for the first time…</p>

<p class="mb1">I started off strong with my daily affirmations for about 3 days in a row, excited to start seeing results in my life.</p>

<p class="mb1">Sadly, nothing changed. But still, I persisted.</p>

<p class="mb1">I continued writing in my journal week after week, waiting for a miracle. But nothing seemed to be working.</p>

<p class="mb1">Over the next several weeks I tried using every law of attraction trick in the book to start seeing results.</p>

<p class="mb1">First, I tried using visualization and imagining what I wanted to achieve.</p>

<p class="mb1">Then, I got more strategic.</p>

<p class="mb1">I started using vision boards, meditation and trying to align my vibrations with what I desired.</p>

<p class="mb1">Nothing seemed to stick for more than a few days.</p>

<p class="mb1">However, in my heart, I knew that there had to be a way I could get out of my rut and get back on the right path quickly.</p>

<p class="mb1">But then, something magical happened.</p>

<p class="mb1">One day I discovered what I like to call the “Abundance Scrolls.” Inside was the secret code that helped me attract the things I desired.</p>

<p class="mb1">However, this “secret code” has frustrated scientists for decades because they have been unable to unlock it’s meaning.</p>

<p class="mb1">During my trial and error I was able to uncover a system that helped me transform my life. I used the secrets I learned in the “Abundance Scrolls” to attract abundance, build better habits, and marry the woman of my dreams.</p>

<p class="mb1">Thanks to this new discovery, I was able to identify the obstacles that were causing me frustration and found a way to deal with them.</p>

<p class="mb1">Soon I had more energy and focus than ever before.</p>

<p class="mb1">The same secrets I discovered can be applied to saving money, losing weight, or finding the love of your life.</p>

<p class="mb1">It can be used for practically any goal you hope to achieve.</p>

<p class="mb1">So, what was the “secret code” I discovered?</p>

<p class="mb1">What I discovered was that although some people use the Law of Attraction to manifest what they desire, it doesn’t work 100% of the time.</p>

<p class="mb1">When you encounter stress or obstacles in your life, research shows that you are very likely to drop your new habit of positive thinking.</p>

<p class="mb1">That is, unless you make one small change.</p>

<p class="mb1">Researchers found that the key to making changes in your life, even during tough times, is to incorporate prayer into your daily routine.</p>

<p class="mb1">So, after discovering this goldmine of information I decided that I would use prayer to help turn my life around and attract abundance into my life.</p>

<p class="mb1">I would admit my powerlessness and seek help from God to put me on the correct path.</p>

<p class="mb1">Sounds easy, right?</p>

<p class="mb1">Well, not for me since I have not always been a religious person.</p>

<p class="mb1">This slight change was going to be difficult for me.</p>

<p class="mb1">You see, I have always been a “type A” personality when it comes to setting goals and creating habits.</p>

<p class="mb1">I’ve always believed that the best way to get the things you want out of life is to put your head down and get to work.</p>

<p class="mb1">But to be honest, that has only taken me so far.</p>

<p class="mb1">Now I needed help from above.</p>

<p class="mb1">It was difficult for me to seek guidance from someone else. </p>

<p class="mb1">Not to mention asking for help from someone that I did not have a very good relationship with.</p>

<p class="mb1">For a long time, I struggled to incorporate prayer into my morning routine. I just didn’t know what to say and would often fumble my words.</p>

<p class="mb1">But then I discovered a forgotten 100-year-old prayer and everything changed for me.</p>

<p class="mb1">I began reading this mysterious prayer each morning, and my life immediately started to improve.</p>

<p class="mb1">Soon I was beginning to attract more money into my life. This transformation was all thanks to incorporating prayer into my routine and admitting my powerlessness to change my habits on my own.</p>

<p class="mb1">Not only was I able to stick with my daily prayer habit, but the money I needed to buy an engagement ring started to flow into my life.</p>

<p class="mb1">I know this might sound a little woo-woo for some of you.</p>

<p class="mb1">But I also know there are others reading this that have experienced this first hand and can back me up on this.</p>

<p class="mb1">Researchers have been ignoring the facts about prayer for decades and only recently have come out saying they were wrong.</p>

<p class="mb1">They said that the effect of prayer on health and happiness was not something they could quantify in a research paper, so they dismissed it.</p>

<p class="mb1">Now there are dozens of studies that show that prayer plays a major role in creating new habits, attracting abundance, living longer and increasing happiness!</p>

<p class="mb1">After learning this, I knew I had to start sharing my story with others, if it could help them, too!</p>

<p class="mb1">Now, if you've ever tried to use the Law of Attraction or positive thinking to attract abundance in your life like I did, you probably know how hard it is to keep going when you don't see any results.</p>

<p class="mb1">After all, you've probably come to realize that no amount of positive thinking will change your physical appearance, your family, the town you're from, or other circumstances in your life that have been holding you back.</p>

<p class="mb1">Here's why that's hard. You know that you have a great deal of unused capacity which you are ready to unleash. Yet you feel like you are missing a special key that will unlock new opportunities for you.</p>

<p class="mb1">My hope is that I can show you what worked for me.</p>

<p class="mb1">What I came to discover was that I was not in control of my journey to abundance like I thought. In fact, God was in complete control of my path. </p>

<p class="mb1">It didn’t matter how many positive thoughts I had if they were not inline with God’s plan for me.</p>

<p class="mb1">So I began to pray and ask for God’s guidance. </p>

<p class="mb1">I have not always been a spiritual person, so praying wasn’t exactly easy for me. I honestly didn’t know what to say. But I tried anyway.</p>

<p class="mb1">I continued this way for a long time without any response from God. Was He hearing my prayers? Did He know what I was going through?</p>

<p class="mb1">Well, everything changed for me when I discovered a forgotten 100-year-old prayer...</p>

<p class="mb1">Is it okay if I share it with you?</p>

<p class="mb1">Let’s pray:</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote mb1">Lord, make me an instrument of your peace.<br>
Where there is hatred, let me bring love.<br>
Where there is offense, let me bring pardon.<br>
Where there is discord, let me bring union.<br>
Where there is error, let me bring truth.<br>
Where there is doubt, let me bring faith.<br>
Where there is despair, let me bring hope.<br>
Where there is darkness, let me bring your light.<br>
Where there is sadness, let me bring joy.<br>
O Master, let me not seek as much<br>
to be consoled as to console,<br>
to be understood as to understand,<br>
to be loved as to love,<br>
for it is in giving that one receives,<br>
it is in self-forgetting that one finds,<br>
it is in pardoning that one is pardoned,<br>
it is in dying that one is raised to eternal life.<br>
In Jesus' name.<br>
Amen.</blockquote>

<p class="mb1">Thank you for joining me in prayer. </p>

<p class="mb1">This prayer was the key that opened my eyes to the power of prayer. And it was the first step in my journey to discovering a path to abundance.</p>

<p class="mb1">Now some of you might be wondering if your life will instantly change after reading this prayer?</p>

<p class="mb1">One of the things I struggled with for the longest time when trying to unlock abundance through prayer was having faith.</p>

<p class="mb1">I had this assumption that if I prayed, miracles would happen instantly. After all, Mark 11:24 says "Whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours."</p>

<p class="mb1">You might be feeling like miracles don't happen if you have yet to have your prayers answered. </p>

<p class="mb1">Is it okay if I share a story with you about Jesus? </p>

<p class="mb1">While Jesus was in Galilee two blind men showed up at his doorstep. The men asked Jesus to have mercy and give them sight. Jesus said “Do you believe that I am able to do this?”</p>

<p class="mb1">When they responded "Yes, Lord." Jesus said “According to your faith be it done to you.” Their eyes immediately opened.</p>

<p class="mb1">What's powerful about this story is that the two blind men did not question the ability of Jesus to heal their eyes. They did not worry what might happen next, they just believed that it was possible.</p>

<p class="mb1">They did not have any doubt that Jesus could heal them. He was their only hope, so they had complete faith.</p>

<p class="mb1">Now contrast this story to that of Matthew 17. A man approaches Jesus asking for mercy to heal his son from suffering. The man says he has tried everything, even asking the other disciples for help, but they could not heal his son.</p>

<p class="mb1">Jesus says this is because his disciples do not have complete faith. He even calls them disobedient. Jesus thought they were deliberately not following his instructions, even though they knew the consequences. </p>

<p class="mb1">Jesus was able to drive the demon out of the boy and heal him. The disciples asked Jesus why they were unable to heal the boy. </p>

<p class="mb1">Jesus said it was because they had such little faith. Even if you had "faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you" </p>

<p class="mb1">If you have been trying to unlock abundance in your life without much success, think about what Jesus said to his disciples. Even if your faith was small you could move mountains. Now imagine if you had great faith? What could you do then?</p>

<p class="mb1">Now, if you’ve been praying for abundance in your life but have yet to have your prayers answered, it can feel like there is not enough to go around. </p>

<p class="mb1">I want to put those fears to rest.</p>
